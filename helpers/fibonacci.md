# Fibonacci

## Introduction

This is going to be a little interlude between the the Project Euler problems because the next problem has to do with Fibonacci numbers! The Fibonacci sequence is generated with two initial numbers, usually 0 and 1, and then adding those two terms to create the next term in the sequence. The sequence continues to infinity by adding the previous two terms in the sequence. The come up in the Project Euler problems because they are mathematically interesting and they present some performance issue when generating them.

This post is going to talk about a three ways to generate Fibonacci numbers, and what the tradeoffs are. 

## Method 1: Recursion

## Method 2: Iteration

## Method 3: Binet's Formula.
